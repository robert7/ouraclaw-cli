## Commands

### `ouraclaw-cli setup`

Interactive onboarding. Collects client credentials, runs OAuth, stores threshold and baseline defaults, and can
optionally hand off into the OpenClaw scheduling walkthrough when `openclaw` is available.

Setup always configures the standalone CLI first. If OpenClaw is unavailable, it skips OpenClaw scheduled delivery,
prints a short explanation before the JSON result, and returns `deliverySetup.reason: "openclaw_unavailable"`.

### `ouraclaw-cli auth login`

Runs the Oura OAuth login flow without changing thresholds, baseline tuning, or schedule settings. Use this when you
only need to re-authenticate.

### `ouraclaw-cli auth status`

Returns JSON describing whether auth is configured, whether the access token is expired, and whether refresh is
possible.

### `ouraclaw-cli auth refresh`

Uses the stored refresh token to fetch fresh tokens and rewrites local state.

### `ouraclaw-cli fetch <endpoint> [--start-date YYYY-MM-DD] [--end-date YYYY-MM-DD]`

Fetches one Oura endpoint. Date handling rules:

- No dates: uses today for both start and end.
- One date: uses that same date for both start and end.
- Two dates: requires `start <= end`.

### `ouraclaw-cli baseline rebuild`

Rebuilds the baseline manually from the previous 21 days excluding today.

### `ouraclaw-cli baseline show`

Prints the stored baseline snapshot or `null` if none exists.

### `ouraclaw-cli config get [key]`

Prints all config/state fields or a specific key. Useful keys include:

- `thresholds.sleepScoreMin`
- `thresholds.readinessScoreMin`
- `thresholds.temperatureDeviationMax`
- `baselineConfig.lowerPercentile`
- `baselineConfig.supportingMetricAlertCount`

### `ouraclaw-cli config set <key> <value>`

Updates a supported config key. Numeric threshold values are validated before writing state.

Useful schedule keys include:

- `schedule.deliveryLanguage`
- `schedule.timezone`
- `schedule.optimizedWatcherDeliveryMode`

### `ouraclaw-cli schedule setup`

Interactive scheduler walkthrough. Detects legacy OuraClaw config and cron jobs, asks for a delivery channel first,
offers known targets as shortcuts while still allowing manual target entry, then collects delivery language, timezone,
which schedules to enable, and the optimized watcher delivery mode before creating or replacing the managed OpenClaw
cron jobs.

### `ouraclaw-cli schedule status`

Prints JSON describing stored schedule config, whether `openclaw` is available, whether matching managed cron jobs
currently exist, and whether legacy OuraClaw cron jobs are still present.

### `ouraclaw-cli schedule disable`

Removes all CLI-managed OpenClaw cron jobs and marks scheduling as disabled without touching auth or summary state.

### `ouraclaw-cli schedule migrate-from-ouraclaw-plugin`

Inspects the old OuraClaw plugin config and known legacy cron jobs, removes the old cron jobs, and imports useful
schedule defaults into current CLI state without creating new jobs.

### `ouraclaw-cli summary morning`

Builds the standard morning recap. Default output is JSON; `--text` prints the sendable message directly.

### `ouraclaw-cli summary morning-optimized [--delivery-mode unusual-only|daily-when-ready]`

Returns JSON for the optimized alerting flow. The result includes `dataReady`, `shouldAlert`, `shouldSend`, optional
`deliveryKey`, `deliveryMode`, optional `deliveryType`, `today`, optional `baseline`, `alertMetrics`, `alertReasons`,
`skipReasons`, and `metricSignals`.

In `daily-when-ready` mode, a ready day without an alert can still return `shouldSend: true` with
`deliveryType: "morning-summary"` plus a nested `morningSummary` payload. `metricSignals` remains populated so the
sender can display all six metrics and mark worse-than-baseline values.

### `ouraclaw-cli summary week-overview [--start-date YYYY-MM-DD] [--end-date YYYY-MM-DD]`

Builds a seven-day JSON overview using the same attention logic as `summary morning-optimized`. With no flags, the
range is the last seven days including today. With only `--start-date`, the range is that date plus the next six days.
With only `--end-date`, the range is that date and the previous six days. With both flags, the inclusive range must be
exactly seven days.

The result includes `period`, `baselineStatus`, `metricOrder`, `overview`, and `days`. Each day includes `weekday`,
`dataReady`, `shouldAlert`, a concise English fallback `summaryLine`, `attentionMetrics`, `missingMetrics`, and compact
`metrics` entries with `key`, raw `value`, `unit`, localized-rendering helper `displayValue`, and `attention`.
`summaryLine` omits missing values and prefixes attention metrics with `⚠️`. For non-English summaries, render from
`metricOrder`, `metrics`, and `attentionMetrics` instead of translating `summaryLine`.

### `ouraclaw-cli summary morning-optimized-confirm --delivery-key <deliveryKey> [--delivery-mode unusual-only|daily-when-ready]`

Confirms that an optimized morning alert was actually delivered. This stores same-day delivery state so later
`summary morning-optimized` runs can suppress duplicates for the rest of the day.

### `ouraclaw-cli summary evening`

Builds the standard evening recap. Default output is JSON; `--text` prints the sendable message directly.

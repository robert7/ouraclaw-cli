# Troubleshooting

## OAuth Times Out

- Confirm your Oura application redirect URI is `http://localhost:9876/callback`.
- Re-run `oura-cli-p setup`.
- Ensure nothing else is already listening on port `9876`.

## OAuth State Validation Fails

The browser callback did not match the initiating request. Close the browser tab and run `oura-cli-p setup` again.

## `summary morning-optimized` Says Data Is Not Ready

The command requires today's `daily_sleep.score`, `daily_readiness.score`, and
`daily_readiness.temperature_deviation`. Wait until Oura has processed the day and retry.

## Baseline Refresh Failed

The command still falls back to fixed thresholds and returns `baselineStatus: "refresh_failed"`. Check Oura API access
with `oura-cli-p fetch sleep --start-date <yesterday> --end-date <today>` and rerun later.

## OpenClaw Cannot Run the Skill

- Install `oura-cli-p` on the same machine as OpenClaw.
- Ensure the binary is on `PATH`.
- Keep the skill command allowlist broad enough for the documented invocations in `skills/oura/SKILL.md`.

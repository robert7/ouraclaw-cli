Based on [Ricky Bloomfield's OuraClaw](https://github.com/rickybloomfield/OuraClaw), this fork refactors the original
OpenClaw plugin into a standalone, JSON-first CLI while keeping the `oura` skill compatible through a CLI-backed
adaptation. It also adds an **[optimized morning flow](docs/guides/optimized-morning-routine.md)** that avoids stale
yesterday fallback data and only sends when something is genuinely out of the ordinary.

`ouraclaw-cli` is a standalone CLI for Oura automation. It fetches Oura data, manages OAuth tokens and local thresholds,
builds summary output, and ships an optional OpenClaw skill that invokes the CLI directly.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @robertvii/ouraclaw-cli
```

Migrating from the old OpenClaw plugin? See [Migration Guide](docs/guides/migrating-from-openclaw-plugin.md).

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robert7/ouraclaw-cli.git
cd ouraclaw-cli
npm install
npm run build
```

## Quick Start

Run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
ouraclaw-cli setup
```

The wizard:

1. Collects your Oura client ID and client secret.
2. Opens the hardened OAuth flow in a browser.
3. Stores tokens plus threshold and baseline defaults in `$HOME/.ouraclaw-cli/ouraclaw-cli.json`.
4. If OpenClaw is installed, can also walk you through cron-based scheduling.

When creating or updating your Oura application, register the redirect URI exactly as
`http://localhost:9876/callback`. Oura validates the redirect URI string literally.

## Common Commands

```bash
ouraclaw-cli fetch daily_sleep
ouraclaw-cli fetch sleep --start-date 2026-03-12 --end-date 2026-03-13
ouraclaw-cli auth status
ouraclaw-cli baseline rebuild
ouraclaw-cli summary morning --text
ouraclaw-cli summary morning-optimized
ouraclaw-cli summary evening --text
```

JSON is the default output mode. Use `--text` on summary commands when you want a ready-to-send recap.

## Scheduling

`ouraclaw-cli` can set up OpenClaw cron jobs for:

- a fixed morning recap
- a fixed evening recap
- an optimized morning watcher that re-checks between a start and end time so you get notified as soon as Oura syncs

Even if you want a morning message every day, the optimized watcher can still be the better setup. It can wait until
today's Oura data is actually synced, then either alert only on unusual days or send every day once the real same-day
data is ready.

Run:

```bash
ouraclaw-cli schedule setup
```

Existing OuraClaw plugin users can also remove old cron jobs and import useful defaults with:

```bash
ouraclaw-cli schedule migrate-from-ouraclaw-plugin
```

See [Scheduling guide](docs/guides/scheduling.md) for the full walkthrough and [Migration Guide](docs/guides/migrating-from-openclaw-plugin.md) for old plugin cleanup.

## Optimized Morning Flow

`summary morning-optimized` is the quiet-by-default alert path: it compares today's Oura data against fixed thresholds
plus your personal baseline and only recommends sending when something is genuinely out of the ordinary. See
[Optimized morning routine](docs/guides/optimized-morning-routine.md) for the full decision logic, baseline tuning, and
delivery-confirmation flow.

The scheduler can also use that same optimized flow for daily delivery. In that mode it still waits for real Oura sync
instead of firing too early, but it sends a normal morning recap once today's data is ready.

## OpenClaw Skill

The packaged skill lives in `skills/oura/`. It requires the `ouraclaw-cli` binary to be installed on the same machine as
OpenClaw and keeps command invocations short and allowlist-friendly.
